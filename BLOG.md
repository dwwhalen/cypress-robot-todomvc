As a test automation engineer, I've had an awareness of [Robot Framework](http://robotframework.org/), but have never had the chance to explore it's capabilities, until now.  I decided to spend a little time familiarizing myself with it's capabilities and that's what I want to talk about in this series of posts.

I'll just be scratching the surface here, but I'll hopefully will provide enough detail to get you started.

## So what is it?
Robot Framework is an open source test automation framework that uses a keyword-driven testing approach to drive the tests.  It is implemented using Python, and is OS independent.

My focus with this post will be automating browser-based tests, but Robot Framework is not limited to browser-based tests.   

In addition to test automation, Robot Framework can be used for [robotic process automation (RPA)](https://robotframework.org/rpa/).

Robot Framework Features

## Extensibility
Robot Framework can make use of many powerful extensions to make the test automation engineer's life a little easier.  

For example, the SeleniumLibrary extension can be user to automate browser interaction, and I'll talk more about that very soon.  

There are also popular extensions to simplify mobile testing, API testing, data-driven testing, and database interactions.  There is even an extension to build automated tests for IBM mainframes!

## Keyword driven
One of the advantages of Robot Framework is that it uses human readable keywords in the test syntax.  Of course the determined test engineer can make tests that are completely unreadable if they work at it, but the Robot Framework makes it eben easier to make things readable.  This is useful when sharing and validating acceptance tests with business stakeholders or folks that would prefer to not read code.

So enough talk, let's look at an example!
